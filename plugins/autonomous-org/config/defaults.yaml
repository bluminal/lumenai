# This is the default configuration for the Autonomous Organization plugin.
# To customize for your project, copy this file to:
#   .autonomous-org/config.yaml
# in your project root.

implementation_plan:

  # Sub-agents that review the draft implementation plan.
  # Each reviewer provides structured feedback (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  # that the Product Manager must address before the plan is finalized.
  #
  # You can:
  #   - Add project-specific reviewers (e.g., security-reviewer, compliance)
  #   - Disable default reviewers by setting enabled: false
  #   - Customize the focus area for each reviewer
  reviewers:
    - agent: architect
      enabled: true
      focus: "Technical architecture, feasibility, NFR coverage, missing technical tasks"

    - agent: designer
      enabled: true
      focus: "Design tasks, UX impact, visual/interaction design clarity"

    - agent: tech-lead
      enabled: true
      focus: "Task clarity, acceptance criteria, parallelizability, dependency accuracy"

  # Maximum number of review loop iterations before forcing completion.
  # Each cycle: reviewers provide feedback → PM addresses it → re-review.
  # If unresolved findings remain after max cycles, they go to Open Questions.
  max_review_cycles: 3

  # Minimum severity level that the Product Manager must address.
  # Options: critical, high, medium, low
  # Default "high" means all CRITICAL and HIGH findings must be resolved.
  min_severity_to_address: high
