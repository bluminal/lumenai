I need you to implement Milestone 2.1 from the following implementation plan. The project uses Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Implementation Plan (excerpt)

**Parallelizable:** Tasks 1 and 2 can run concurrently.

## Project Config

The project has `.synthex-plus/config.yaml` with default settings. The experimental Agent Teams flag is set.

CLAUDE.md says: Use Vitest for testing, 80% coverage threshold, TypeScript strict mode.
