# Gitleaks configuration for LumenAI
#
# The test fixtures in tests/fixtures/security/ contain intentionally
# fake credentials designed to test the security-reviewer agent.
# These are non-functional values taken from vendor documentation
# (e.g., AWS example keys, Stripe test keys) or are obviously fake
# (e.g., "FakeSecretKeyNotRealAtAll").
#
# This configuration suppresses false-positive alerts from those fixtures
# and their corresponding golden snapshot outputs.
